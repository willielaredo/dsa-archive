    <h2 id="a-on-the-features-of-advanced-monopoly-capitalism">A. ON THE FEATURES OF ADVANCED MONOPOLY CAPITALISM:</h2>

<h3 id="the-imperialist-economy">The Imperialist Economy</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The American economy, the center of the world
imperialist system, is dominated by the monopoly
sector, primarily based in production industries.</li>
  <li>Imperialism played a crucial role in post-World War 11expansion, providing raw materials and
cheap labor from the Third World, and markets from
the Third World and other capitalist states.</li>
  <li>Direct foreign investment, rather than trade,
is now the major means of securing markets in foreign countries.</li>
  <li>The state now plays a major role in rationalizing the economy, providing new investment opportunities, and socializing indirect costs of production like education, health, transportation facilities.</li>
  <li>By organized violence, the state continues to
serve ruling class interests against individual dissidents
and, especially in times of crisis, organized insurgencies.</li>
  <li>The competitive sector, composed of services,
retailers, small industry, building and real estate interests, small financial institutions, operates primarily
on local and state levels.</li>
  <li>Financial institutions play a central part in providing investment funds and coordinating monopoly policies.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-divisions-of-labor">The divisions of labor</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Advanced capitalism increases the divisions of
labor and the differentiation of the working class.</li>
  <li>High paid, skilled jobs are primarily in the
monopoly sector and are the preserve primarily of
white males.</li>
  <li>The weak position of the US labor movement led labor leaders to seek accomodation with
capital; accomodation has only been feasible in the
monopoly and, to a lesser extent, the state sectors.</li>
  <li>This accomodation has meant union acceptance of productivity increase, of management’s right
to run the plant, and of the obligation to discipline
members to keep the terms of the contract, in return for union recognition and wage gains tied to
productivity and/or the cost of living.</li>
  <li>The state played a key role in fostering this
accomodation, setting up the legal and institutional
framework to facilitate it, and disciplining unions
going beyond approved limits of militancy.</li>
  <li>The monopoly sector, especially, has intensified
the minute divisions of labor in the work process,
even within the same skill levels; it also sustains the
sexual division of labor within the home by emphasizing women-as-consumers.</li>
  <li>Women and oppressed racial and national minorities are consigned primarily to lower levels of
the state sector and monopoly enterprise, and to
the competitive sector; their relative position has suffered from the displacement of inflation and tax
burdens from the monopoly sector.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-social-and-cultural-hegemony-of-the-ruling-class">The social and cultural hegemony of the ruling class</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The ruling class has used the cultural media
to infuse its values and assumptions throughout
society. Education, for instance, transmits most
information about the society, leaving those who
would rebel without any coherent alternative understanding, fragmented and disorganized.</li>
  <li>Capitalist ideology reproduces fundamental
archetypes of oppression: adult/child, man/woman,
and adapts those archetypes to its needs–creating
continuing models for master/servant relationships
in all spheres of social existence.</li>
  <li>Capitalist ideology develops such archetypes
to create modes of behavior which meet its needs:
an obedient, repressed, individualistic labor force; a
passive fragmented mass of consumers.</li>
  <li>The sanctity of property relationships builds
upon the model of the family as property and the
myth that defense of private ownership of the productive apparatus is necessary to defend the right to
own necessities (e.g. houses, food, etc.)</li>
  <li>Capitalist ideology perpetuates the model of
“democratic pluralism” as the only possible model
for the political resolution of conflict. It maintains
the cult of the expert-as-problem-solver, a mythology
that mystifies and disorganizes conflict in the society.</li>
  <li>The ruling class has discrete agencies (media,
foundations, business councils, etc.) that articulate,
and implement its policies.</li>
  <li>The core of cultural integration in America
has been the myth of affluence for those within the
“American mainstream,” inseparably linked with the
implied threat that “aliens”–especially the black
colony–pose to the “common community.”</li>
</ol>

<p>B. ON THE END OF THE AMERICAN ERA</p>

<h3 id="the-economic-crisis-challenge-to-hegemony">The economic crisis: challenge to hegemony</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In the post-war period, US firms could exercise effective monopolies in the markets for which
they competed or.which they sought to dominate.
This period is at an end, due to inflation in the US and
competition from modernized capitalist competitors.</li>
  <li>Third World natiorialist and revolutionary
challenge has made control and defense of the empire
increasingly costly.</li>
  <li>Persistent inflationary tendencies since World
War 11 brought about in part by the increased employm~nt in the state sector (especially the military),
have increased consumer buying power without increasing the supply of goods.</li>
  <li>The expansion of non-productive state employment has been necessary to stimulate; demand
and absorb surplus labor (prevent depression and reduce unemployment) and to meet the military demands of maintaining the US world empire.</li>
  <li>The ability of unions in the monopoly
sector to obtain cost-of-living gains beyond wages
determined by productivity has aggravated this tendency to inflation and redistributed its effects within
the working class to workers in the state and competitive sectors.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="structural-unemployment">Structural unemployment</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The US economy persistently tends to high
unemployment due to automation and other productivity measures in the monopoly sector; new jobs
cannot be created in competitive and state sectors to
absorb the growing job seekers.</li>
  <li>Women, racial minorities, youth, the old are
placed at a disadvantage in the competition for
scarce jobs.</li>
  <li>A number of institutions function to hold
members of these groups out of the labor market,
releasing them if labor grows scarce; these include the
family, schools, the military, and compulsory retirement</li>
  <li>Educational requirements for jobs have risen
out of proportion to needed skills; as more become
educated, those already advantaged seek to raise requirements in order to preserve their labor market
positions and those of their children.</li>
  <li>There is an increasing number of highly educated workers whose jobs require only a fraction of
their skills and who have no prospect of better jobs.</li>
  <li>Increasing numbers of youth are leaving school
and have only a tenuous connection with employment; drop-outs are the core of youth culture; their
rejection of capitalist work and success ethics is
attractive to many struggling with the frustrations of education and alienating jobs.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-political-crisis">The political crisis</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The sixties witnessed the erosion of the poli-
tical consensus of the post war period and growing
self-consciousness of major blocs within the
working class: e.g. racial and national minorities,
women, youth, industrial and white collar workers.</li>
  <li>Programmatic and ideological links between
diverse sectors of the working class have not yet
been developed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-political-response">The political response</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The erosion of the political and economic
hegemony of American imperialism creates major
contradictions that threaten the agreement between
labor and capital, generate structural imperatives for
increased productivity and rationalization, and tend
to freeze the labor position of minorities, women,
and youth.</li>
  <li>The state plays a pivotal role in this crisis,
assuming increased social and indirect costs of production (education, pollution clean-up, etc.), as it
acts more and more directly to rationalize the economy. At the same time, the state sector experiences rising unionization of workers and, pressed to
raise revenue from already rebellious middle-income
tax payers, faces an acute fiscal crisis.</li>
  <li>The revolt of women and minorities generates
continuing pressure for rationalization of the political
• economy.</li>
  <li>In response to the crisis, liberal capitalism,
rooted in the monopoly sector, hi,isformulated
“reform” programs that seek rationalization of the
economy, reallocation of state budgetary priorities,
and a lowered profile abroad (stabilization of the
Asian and European balance, renewed attention to
primary .spheres of American influence and invest-
ment–East Africa, the Middle East, Latin America,
etc.). These programs assume and sustain conflicts
of interest between sectors of the working class,
assuming, for instance, that expanded state services,
environmental cleanup, urban reconstruction, be paid
for by middle income tax payers, or that expanded
minority job opportunities come at the expense of
white workers.</li>
  <li>Such programs contrast with the reactionary
currents based on national industries and local interests, located in the competitive sector. Reactionary
politicians capitalize upon the fears of large numbers
of working people about the decay of order and play
upon the divisions within the working population.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="c-toward-a-socialist-alternative">C. TOWARD A SOCIALIST ALTERNATIVE</h2>
<h3 id="the-new-american-movement">The New American Movement</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the current context, NAM must offer an
explicitly socialist alternative, both programmatic and
theoretical, to ruling class reforms and reactionary
programs. It can be neither a disciplined party nor a
loose coalition but must combine elements of both.</li>
  <li>NAM must bring together diverse constituencies, experimenting with a variety of organizing
efforts, and providing a medium for theoretical and
practical exchange.</li>
  <li>NAM must also advance the process of left
cohesion, offer an explicitly socialist alternative, and
constantly politicize mass struggles.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="strategic-criteria">Strategic criteria</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Any strategy based on one sector of the working class is inadequate for a revolutionary movement.</li>
  <li>The revolutionary goal is to unite now divided
sectors and to break down divisions of social life:
production/consumption, family/community, work/education.</li>
  <li>The dissolution of the agreement between
capital and labor in the monopoly sector and the
entrance of industrial workers into class-wide coalitions is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
the emergence of a revolutionary movement.</li>
  <li>The developing consciousness of white collar
and technical workers–that they are structurally oppressed by their relationship to the productive process is an essential component of an emerging revolutionary force. In the state and service sectors
especially, such consciousness contains a demystification of the role of expert, a challenge to the structure and purpose of social services, and a growing
awareness of the regressive mechanisms for financial
support of service.</li>
  <li>The growing rebellion of women challenges
both archetypes of cultural and psychological oppression and the role of women in the productive
process as surplus and unpaid labor. The women s
movement will retain a dimension of autonomy,
even as it allies itself with the class as a whole.</li>
  <li>The emerging black (and third world) revolutionary movement represents a challen~e. to the
racial division of labor, which has long divided and weakened the working class as a whole, and also signals an internationalization of struggle; like the
women’s movement, it will continue to retain a cultural and political integrity within the emerging revolutionary class movement.</li>
  <li>The youth movement represents a fundamental
critique of capitalist modes of consumption and
work. Yet, based as it is on forces not integrated
into the productive process, alone it will continue to
be utopian and escapist, unable to mobilize the resources, galvanize a collective force, or develop a
program for revolutionary transformation of that
process.</li>
  <li>Mass sociaiist consciousness grows from struggles that unite diverse sectors of the working population and bring together now compartmentalized
spheres of life in alliances around common programs
that clarify class conflict and provide the basis for a
vision of a total reconstruction of social relations.</li>
  <li>A revolutionary movement must sharpen class
divisions by clarifying the material class interests of
working people as a class, demanding that all reforms be paid for by redistribution of wealth from the ruling class (with special focus on the state policies
like nature of expenditures, taxes, New Economic
Policy).</li>
  <li>Such a movement must, in the context of
class wide struggle, fight to end special oppression of
women, third world people, youth, and the aged.</li>
  <li>Such a movement must clarify the quality of
class struggle by demonstrating that the ruling class
defines the character and ends of all institutional life
–the work place, the school, social services, entertainment, etc. according to the imperatives
of profit making.</li>
  <li>It must fiercely defend working class institutions and uncompromisingly support the right to self-determination for women and national minorities,
and the right of workers to organize and strike.</li>
  <li>It must also take the initiative in struggle for
expansion of existing areas, and the creation of
new areas, of working class control: demanding, for
instance, free child care and a variety of other services controlled by consumers and workers; demanding the training of workers and the reorganization of
work to allow a variety of tasks and control over
the productive process by workers themselves; demand
ing schools serve the interests of workers, children,
women, minorities, etc.</li>
  <li>In the context of such specific struggles communities of the oppressed can be created to articulate
a revolutionary vision of work, service, recreation,
family and community.</li>
  <li>Focus on state budgetary policies and administration can’ unite questions of distribution and
control demonstrating the role of the state in transferring ‘wealth to the ruling cla~s and. in shaping services to fit the interests of profit-making.</li>
  <li>A revolutionary movement must be internationalist It must actively support the struggles of
the oppressed everywhere (Vietnamese, South African,
Northern Irish) as its own.</li>
