1. Internal Education

The National Interim Committee shall develop an educational program on the economy for all N.A. M. chapters.

2. Strike Support 

We support all strikes that attempt to break the wage guidelines; we give priority to wildcat, illegal, and profit-limiting strikes. We encourage union sanctioned and wildcat strikes to extend their struggle into the arena of corporate and state policy, as a basic method of transforming the divisive character of these policies. Wherever possible we attempt to bring to these strikes class-wide demands which can bring together all sections of the working class around a common interest program. (For instance, when public employees strike for higher wages, rather than setting their demands in conflict with the community N.A.M. should demand that the government tax the rich to pay for it, and not use it as a rationale to cut back public services to the poor.) We are also committed to fighting all anti-working class, anti-strike legislation and actions on the part of the government (Taft-Hartley, anti-strike laws, use on injunctions, and so on.) 

The following key strategic objectives should provide guidelines for N.A.M. strike support work: 
1. The workers themselves playing an active political role (for instance, creating the opportunity for striking workers to bring their message to the community––at union halls, campuses, church groups, clubs, etc.) 
2. Winning, by means of building up an offensive momentum, and by a dramatic presentation of the issues to the public at large.
3. Education of the youth on pro-working class lines, and calling on unions to develop a program which is oriented toward the needs of youth.
4. Calling on unions to develop programs to meet the needs of women and national minorities; and urging that minorities and women operate respectively as collective bodies to determine their needs and to pressure the trade unions to satisfy these demands.
5. Meeting the needs of the strikers (e.g., access to legal assistance, printing facilities, day care assistance, supplies, etc.)
