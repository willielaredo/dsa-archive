# Letter from National Office ad hoc Temporary Collective
Dear Sisters and Brothers,

After the smoke cleared from the confusion of the last plenary, the new National Interim Committee met and decided the following: 

1. The temporary national office will be in Minneapolis (three people on the NIC live there, office space is available, there are two chapters to draw on for support). 
2. The next issue of the paper will again come from Berkeley, it's location until June will be decided later. It will describe the programmatic proposals coming out of the conference, Jim Weinstein will be responsible for this issue. 
3. Duty assignments to be completed by the next NIC meeting were divided in the following way: 
   1. Marv Davidov and Fred Ojile would take responsibility for the National office. 
   2. Staughton Lynd will develop a pamphlet on the economic program.
   3. Harry Boyte will have a pamphlet together on occupational health and safety. 
   4. Patty Lee Parmalee will develop a possible outline for an internal education program. 
   5. Pam Beardsley will begin developing a program on anti-war and imperialism. 

This letter is coming from an ad hoc temporary staff from the two Minneapolis chapters. We're not exactly gleeful about doing the National Office, being like everybody else overworked already, but we understand its importance in facilitating outward growth and internal cross-communication. At this time the national office consists of a cardboard box full of files, a mailing list and $900. $500 goes to the printing and mailing of the next issue of the paper. That doesn't leave much for office expenses or staff. So sometime soon we're all going to have to talk about fundraising.
