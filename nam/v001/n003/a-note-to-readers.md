The Berkeley chapter debated at length how to organize this issue. Well aware of this Newspaper's "mistakes of the past," we wondered whether 1) to delay publication in order to solicit different interpretations of conference events from the various chapters or 2) to put out this issue quickly so that a presentation of the conference and its decisions could be used as an organizing tool arid basis of.discussion for chapters. We decided on the latter because we view the newspaper as the organ for an ongoing political discussion on the directions for NAM. In our view this first issue after the conference should be limited to an introduction to that debate. Hereafter we hope to see the newspaper filled with reports from chapters on their ideas and perspectives on the issues facing NAM. We ask all NAM chapters to send us news of your activities, suggestions for the paper, and your views on the conference. 

We also hope to begin to assemble a file of graphics and poetry for future use in the paper. Suggestions and submissions would be most welcome. We ask that they be typed double spaced with 20 x 80 margins, please. Please send all submissions, suggestions and whatever to:
