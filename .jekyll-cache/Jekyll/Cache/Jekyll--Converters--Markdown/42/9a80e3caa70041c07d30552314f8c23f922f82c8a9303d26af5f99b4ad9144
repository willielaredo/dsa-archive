I"a<p>The current National Interim Committee wishes to propose the following structural proposal for NAM after Thanksgiving, incorporating a number of criticisms and comments we have received on the original proposal.</p>

<p>We propose for the continuing national structure of NAM an interim committee of 13, at least half women, to be elected by the voting delegates at the conference in a plenary-of-the-whole. In voting for members of the interim committee, delegates should be informed by the knowledge of the specific tasks that the interim committee will have to perform. We foresee the following priorities for the NIC:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An extensive program of political education, utilizing a variety of media, that deals with both broader political issues-like the contours of an American socialism, American foreign policy, racism and sexism, and also specific issues, like how particular priority programs fit into a broader socialist analysis.</li>
  <li>Development of program areas in general, and priority programs in particular. The NIC may well decide to form task forces to facilitate its work in program development and coordination. Two women on the NIC are instructed to develop a women’s caucus which would discuss the nature of a women’s program in NAM.</li>
  <li>The development of regions, in consultation with local chapters, along lines that are functional to the programs and interests of local groups.</li>
  <li>Fund-raising</li>
  <li>Newspaper</li>
  <li>Hiring of staff.</li>
  <li>Office and internal communication.</li>
  <li>Press relations.</li>
  <li>Plans for founding convention.</li>
</ol>
