I"Ÿ<p>Dear Sisters and Brothers,</p>

<p>After the smoke cleared from the confusion of the last plenary, the new National Interim Committee met and decided the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The temporary national office will be in Minneapolis (three people on the NIC live there, office space is available, there are two chapters to draw on for support).</li>
  <li>The next issue of the paper will again come from Berkeley, itâ€™s location until June will be decided later. It will describe the programmatic proposals coming out of the conference, Jim Weinstein will be responsible for this issue.</li>
  <li>Duty assignments to be completed by the next NIC meeting were divided in the following way:
    <ol>
      <li>Marv Davidov and Fred Ojile would take responsibility for the National office.</li>
      <li>Staughton Lynd will develop a pamphlet on the economic program.</li>
      <li>Harry Boyte will have a pamphlet together on occupational health and safety.</li>
      <li>Patty Lee Parmalee will develop a possible outline for an internal education program.</li>
      <li>Pam Beardsley will begin developing a program on anti-war and imperialism.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This letter is coming from an ad hoc temporary staff from the two Minneapolis chapters. Weâ€™re not exactly gleeful about doing the National Office, being like everybody else overworked already, but we understand its importance in facilitating outward growth and internal cross-communication. At this time the national office consists of a cardboard box full of files, a mailing list and $900. $500 goes to the printing and mailing of the next issue of the paper. That doesnâ€™t leave much for office expenses or staff. So sometime soon weâ€™re all going to have to talk about fundraising.
